\section{Introduction}
A single pendulum is a classical example of simple harmonic motion. When released from a height, the pendulum will swing periodically and consistently. By simply adding a second pendulum at the end of the first, the system transforms into a classical example of chaotic motion. Even though these two systems are governed by the same physical laws of motion and only being acted upon by one force (gravity), a double pendulum is \emph{heavily} dependent on initial conditions. To analyze the system's behavior, we approximate the solution using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method."
