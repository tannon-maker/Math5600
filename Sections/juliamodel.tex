\section{Implementing Numerical model}
The full Julia code used to execute the system used in this derivation can be found in \appref{A}. Now that we have a first order differential equation, we can implement it into a Runge-Kutta model. These kinds of methods are incredibly accurate even for chaotic dynamical systems.
